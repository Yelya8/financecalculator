# Finance Calculator

A program that allows the user to access two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

If the user selects investment, they will be asked to input:

2.	Interest rate
3.	The number of years they are planning to invest
4.	User has a choice between simple or compound interest
Once the user has entered these details, the program will return an amount based on the interest type that was selected.

If the user selects bond, they will be asked to input:
1.	The present value of their house
2.	The interest rate
3.	The number of months they plan to take to repay the bond
Once the user has entered these details, the program will return the total monthly payment to be made.
